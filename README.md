## 🧭 Who Even Am I?

Well, it's a long journey of mine... and honestly, I'm just getting started.
You’ve landed in my little corner of GitHub — where backend meets blue teaming, and where building dreams is just another day.

I’m a cybersecurity student — sure.  
But also a full-stack dev who *actually enjoys* fixing bugs at 2 AM (don’t ask how many coffees that took).  
And yes, I take pride in being that team member who brings people together — pushing through deadlines, planning chaos, and making it all... work.

## 🎯 What Am I Into?

Let’s make this easy:

- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity** (Blue Teaming, Logs, Threat Detection, SIEM, IR)
- 🧑🏻‍💻 **Full Stack Dev** (Backend-heavy but frontend isn't scary anymore (sometimes it does, but i'll still try 😅))
- 🌍 **Team Collaboration** (Especially with people from different mindsets — love the chaos)
- 💡 **Entrepreneurship** (Ideas. Prototypes. Pitching. Repeat.)
- 🎯 **Leadership** (Organizing, strategizing, mentoring — I’ve done it all)
- 🧠 **Communication** (Tech is powerful, but explaining it clearly? AURA???)
